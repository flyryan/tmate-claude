# Terminal-Claude Integration System

This project aims to create a terminal integration system that allows Claude AI to interact with a terminal session while maintaining security and user control.

## Overview

The system provides:
- Real-time terminal interaction with AI assistance
- Secure command execution with user approval
- Support for multiple AI providers (Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible APIs)
- Configurable system prompts and context management

## Key Features

- **Terminal Integration**: Real-time terminal session monitoring and interaction
- **Command Control**: User approval system for AI-suggested commands
- **Dual Interface**: Separate windows for terminal and AI chat
- **API Flexibility**: Support for both Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible APIs
- **Security First**: Built-in guardrails and command sanitization
